# UEM-Hacktoberfest
This repo is for the people of UEM Jaipur (also open for anyone and everyone) to learn and understand the concepts of git and github.
My goal for creating this repo is for them to understand open source and fall in love with it .
Lets start yor first open source contribution with Hacktoberfest 2023.
